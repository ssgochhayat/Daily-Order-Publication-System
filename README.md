Now a days notice board has become an important thing in organization or public places like railway stations, bus stands, hospitals. But to use the paper notices stacked on a notice board is a time taking and expensive process and there is wastage of lots of time, paper and labour. Here the project deals with website application where it displays the latest information by enhancing the system. The device can be used anywhere irrespective of the place of deployment provided mobile network connectivity is available.
